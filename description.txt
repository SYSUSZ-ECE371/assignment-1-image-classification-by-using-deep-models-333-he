The code of 2 exercise are uploaded to the folder EX1, EX2. 
  The EX1 folder is modificated from the original mmpretrain github repository,and the main modofication is the add the folder ~\configs\flowers, which saved the config file of different models. 
    The folder worker_dir saved the finetune log of models. 
    The EX2 folder includes several different modifications(including the modification of the last layer and the different use of optimizers). 
    The folder figure include some validation accuracy graphs.
    Because the files of training weights are too big to upload, I created a new github repo to store them, they can be looked up in https://github.com/333-he/hw1.git.
